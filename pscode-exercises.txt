// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number
check if number is divisible by 2 with no remainder
if it is print even, if not print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
var currentaverage =
add all the numbers up and divide them by 5
var currentsmallest
go through all numbers setting currentsmallest if it is less than the variable
var currentbiggest
go through all numbers setting currentsmallest if it is more than the variable
print "Number forecast: the average of the numbers is " currentaverage " with highs of " current biggest " and lows of " currentsmallest
